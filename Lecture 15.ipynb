COMPARISON: 4/10/2013 TECHNIQUE: After IV administration of 86 ml of Isovue 370, helical CT imaging of the abdomen was performed axially during the arterial, portal venous, and delayed phases. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were reviewed. Based on a 32-cm body phantom, the estimated radiation dose (CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series in this exam are: 1.99, 11.95, 6.47, 6.43, 6.50. The estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is: 512. NOTE: The radiation dose indicators for CT -- the 'volume CT Dose Index' (CTDIvol) given in milli-Gray (mGy), and the Dose Length Product (DLP) given in mGy-centimeters (mGy.cm) -- are generated from the CT scanner to estimate radiation exposure based on technical study parameters and a reference phantom. The CTDI and DLP may therefore substantially over- or underestimate an individual's absorbed dose based on patient size and other factors.  FINDINGS: Lung bases are clear. Heart size is normal. No pleural or pericardial effusion. ABDOMEN: Hepatic morphology suggestive of cirrhosis is again demonstrated, including hypertrophy of the lateral segment, widening of the fissures, mildly nodular hepatic contour, and corkscrew appearance of the hepatic arteries. Multiple small hypervascular hepatic lesions with associated delayed washout appear essentially unchanged and again are diagnostic of hepatocellular carcinoma in this context. Lesions include the following: 10-mm segment 7 lesion (5:76)9 mm segment 8 lesion (5:64)8-mm segment 2 lesion (5:75)7-mm segment 4a lesion (5:47) The following two lesions do not as clearly exhibit washout, likely due to their small size. They are therefore nonspecific but remain concerning.5-mm segment 5 lesion (5:99)5-mm segment 1 lesion (5:64) There is no evidence of vascular invasion by any of these tumors. The TIPS extending from the distal main portal vein, right portal vein, and right hepatic vein appears widely patent. Major hepatic vasculature appears patent. Accessory left hepatic artery is again demonstrated. The gallbladder has been removed. The spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys appear normal. Imaged portions of small and large bowel appear normal. The abdominal aorta is normal in course and caliber. Major abdominal vasculature is patent. No abdominal lymphadenopathy. No ascites. No free intraperitoneal air. No aggressive osseous lesion is identified in the abdomen. IMPRESSION: 1. ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED APPEARANCE OF 4 SMALL (8-10 MM) HCC LESIONS AS DETAILED. TWO SMALLER ENHANCING LESIONS ARE ALSO CONCERNING BUT NONSPECIFIC AS THEY DO NOT AS CLEARLY EXHIBIT WASHOUT, LIKELY DUE TO THEIR SMALL SIZE. 2. HEPATIC MORPHOLOGY SUGGESTIVE OF CIRRHOSIS.

       "\"CT Abdomen with contrast, Triphasic Liver Protocol INDICATION: Hepatocellular carcinoma. History of alcoholic cirrhosis status post TIPS placement. COMPARISON: 4/10/2013 TECHNIQUE: After IV administration of 86 ml of Isovue 370, helical CT imaging of the abdomen was performed axially during the arterial, portal venous, and delayed phases. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were reviewed. Based on a 32-cm body phantom, the estimated radiation dose (CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series in this exam are: 1.99, 11.95, 6.47, 6.43, 6.50. The estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is: 512. NOTE: The radiation dose indicators for CT -- the 'volume CT Dose Index' (CTDIvol) given in milli-Gray (mGy), and the Dose Length Product (DLP) given in mGy-centimeters (mGy.cm) -- are generated from the CT scanner to estimate radiation exposure based on technical study parameters and a reference phantom. The CTDI and DLP may therefore substantially over- or underestimate an individual's absorbed dose based on patient size and other factors.  FINDINGS: Lung bases are clear. Heart size is normal. No pleural or pericardial effusion. ABDOMEN: Hepatic morphology suggestive of cirrhosis is again demonstrated, including hypertrophy of the lateral segment, widening of the fissures, mildly nodular hepatic contour, and corkscrew appearance of the hepatic arteries. Multiple small hypervascular hepatic lesions with associated delayed washout appear essentially unchanged and again are diagnostic of hepatocellular carcinoma in this context. Lesions include the following: 10-mm segment 7 lesion (5:76)9 mm segment 8 lesion (5:64)8-mm segment 2 lesion (5:75)7-mm segment 4a lesion (5:47) The following two lesions do not as clearly exhibit washout, likely due to their small size. They are therefore nonspecific but remain concerning.5-mm segment 5 lesion (5:99)5-mm segment 1 lesion (5:64) There is no evidence of vascular invasion by any of these tumors. The TIPS extending from the distal main portal vein, right portal vein, and right hepatic vein appears widely patent. Major hepatic vasculature appears patent. Accessory left hepatic artery is again demonstrated. The gallbladder has been removed. The spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys appear normal. Imaged portions of small and large bowel appear normal. The abdominal aorta is normal in course and caliber. Major abdominal vasculature is patent. No abdominal lymphadenopathy. No ascites. No free intraperitoneal air. No aggressive osseous lesion is identified in the abdomen. IMPRESSION: 1. ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED APPEARANCE OF 4 SMALL (8-10 MM) HCC LESIONS AS DETAILED. TWO SMALLER ENHANCING LESIONS ARE ALSO CONCERNING BUT NONSPECIFIC AS THEY DO NOT AS CLEARLY EXHIBIT WASHOUT, LIKELY DUE TO THEIR SMALL SIZE. 2. HEPATIC MORPHOLOGY SUGGESTIVE OF CIRRHOSIS.  SUMMARY:4-POSSIBLY SIGNIFICANT FINDING, MAY NEED ACTIONI have personally reviewed the images for this examination and agreedwith the report transcribed above.\""

       "\"CT Abdomen with contrast, Triphasic Liver Protocol INDICATION: Hepatocellular carcinoma. History of alcoholic cirrhosis status post TIPS placement. COMPARISON: 4/10/2013 TECHNIQUE: After IV administration of 86 ml of Isovue 370, helical CT imaging of the abdomen was performed axially during the arterial, portal venous, and delayed phases. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were reviewed. Based on a 32-cm body phantom, the estimated radiation dose (CTDIvol [mGy]) for each series in this exam are: 1.99, 11.95, 6.47, 6.43, 6.50. The estimated cumulative dose (DLP [mGy-cm]) is: 512. NOTE: The radiation dose indicators for CT -- the 'volume CT Dose Index' (CTDIvol) given in milli-Gray (mGy), and the Dose Length Product (DLP) given in mGy-centimeters (mGy.cm) -- are generated from the CT scanner to estimate radiation exposure based on technical study parameters and a reference phantom. The CTDI and DLP may therefore substantially over- or underestimate an individual's absorbed dose based on patient size and other factors.  FINDINGS: Lung bases are clear. Heart size is normal. No pleural or pericardial effusion. ABDOMEN: Hepatic morphology suggestive of cirrhosis is again demonstrated, including hypertrophy of the lateral segment, widening of the fissures, mildly nodular hepatic contour, and corkscrew appearance of the hepatic arteries. Multiple small hypervascular hepatic lesions with associated delayed washout appear essentially unchanged and again are diagnostic of hepatocellular carcinoma in this context. Lesions include the following: 10-mm segment 7 lesion (5:76)9 mm segment 8 lesion (5:64)8-mm segment 2 lesion (5:75)7-mm segment 4a lesion (5:47) The following two lesions do not as clearly exhibit washout, likely due to their small size. They are therefore nonspecific but remain concerning.5-mm segment 5 lesion (5:99)5-mm segment 1 lesion (5:64) There is no evidence of vascular invasion by any of these tumors. The TIPS extending from the distal main portal vein, right portal vein, and right hepatic vein appears widely patent. Major hepatic vasculature appears patent. Accessory left hepatic artery is again demonstrated. The gallbladder has been removed. The spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys appear normal. Imaged portions of small and large bowel appear normal. The abdominal aorta is normal in course and caliber. Major abdominal vasculature is patent. No abdominal lymphadenopathy. No ascites. No free intraperitoneal air. No aggressive osseous lesion is identified in the abdomen. IMPRESSION: 1. ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED APPEARANCE OF 4 SMALL (8-10 MM) HCC LESIONS AS DETAILED. TWO SMALLER ENHANCING LESIONS ARE ALSO CONCERNING BUT NONSPECIFIC AS THEY DO NOT AS CLEARLY EXHIBIT WASHOUT, LIKELY DUE TO THEIR SMALL SIZE. 2. HEPATIC MORPHOLOGY SUGGESTIVE OF CIRRHOSIS.  SUMMARY:4-POSSIBLY SIGNIFICANT FINDING, MAY NEED ACTIONI have personally reviewed the images for this examination and agreedwith the report transcribed above.\""
